# Nodens Application Template

A minimal C++23 application template using [Nodens](https://github.com/EldritchCodex/Nodens).

> ⚠️ The published development environment currently builds and validates Nodens applications for Linux only. Native Windows and macOS builds are not currently supported or validated.

## Prerequisites

Install Docker and an editor with Dev Container support:

- [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

This template uses the published Linux graphics image:

```text
ghcr.io/eldritchcodex/arch-dev:main
```

The included `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` uses NVIDIA by default with
`--gpus=all`. NVIDIA hosts need a working host driver and NVIDIA Container
Toolkit configured in Docker. See the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation
guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

For Intel/AMD, comment the NVIDIA `runArgs` and uncomment the `/dev/dri`,
`video`, and `render` arguments. Keep exactly one `runArgs` block active.

## Getting Started

1. Create a repository from this template or clone it locally.
2. Open the project folder in Zed or Visual Studio Code.
3. Choose **Reopen in Container** or the equivalent Dev Container action.
4. Open a terminal inside the container.
5. Configure, build, and run the application:

   ```shell
   cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   cmake --build build --target NodensApp
   ./build/NodensApp
   ```

The first CMake configuration downloads Nodens and its dependencies with `FetchContent`. You do not need to clone or build the Nodens repository separately.

For reproducible builds, replace `GIT_TAG dev` in `CMakeLists.txt` with a specific Nodens commit hash. The `dev` branch tracks ongoing development and may change without notice.
